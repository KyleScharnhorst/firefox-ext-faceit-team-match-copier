Faceit will not allow you to easily view a league oppenent's vetos / maps played.

Faceit's open API will not allow you to look at a team's match history.

So what can we do? We can grab a teams match history using this firefox extension. With that match history we can interact with the faceit API to get match details as well as vetos for a given match. Faceit won't do it for us, so I will.
