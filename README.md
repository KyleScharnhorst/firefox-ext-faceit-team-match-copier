Faceit will not allow you to easily view a league oppenent's vetos / maps played.

Faceit's open API will not allow you to look at a team's match history.

So what can we do? We can grab a teams match history using this firefox extension. With that match history we can interact with the faceit API to get match details as well as vetos for a given match. Faceit won't do it for us, so I will.

So all this extension does is copy all match IDs to your clipboard when visiting a team's league page.
Example:

https://www.faceit.com/en/teams/30dd56ee-d645-4cd7-a7ca-e2ce5b7eddd8/leagues

clicking the extension button on the toolbar will copy the matches for the current season. You will have to click to other seasons and copy again.

With that data you can paste it into another application. I'll make one and link it here. TODO.
